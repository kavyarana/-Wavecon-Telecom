Wavecon 5G Analysis Project


Introduction
Hello, I'm Kavya, a junior data analyst. This repository outlines my analysis of Wavecon's 5G services, focusing on performance indicators before and after the launch. My work aims to support top management in enhancing active user rates and other key metrics.


Objectives
KPI Comparison Report: Analyze and present a comprehensive comparison of key performance indicators (KPIs) for Wavecon's 5G services pre- and post-launch.

Insightful Video Presentation: Create a video presentation summarizing insights gathered from the virtual internship dashboard, aimed at providing a clear overview of the data analysis. You can listen to my audio presentation here.



Dataset Overview
The analysis utilizes six CSV files, each offering valuable insights into Wavecon’s 5G services and the telecommunications sector. Here’s a brief summary of each file:

dim_cities: Contains city codes and names, providing geographical context.
dim_date: Details monthly dates, month names, and categorization into before and after the 5G launch.
dim_plan: Lists various internet plans offered by Wavecon, along with brief descriptions.
fact_wavecon_metrics: Captures key metrics like revenue, active users, and unsubscribed users per month and city.
fact_market_share: Provides information on market share percentages and competitors in different cities.
fact_plan_revenue: Highlights revenue generated from specific internet plans over time.
This dataset forms the foundation for a thorough analysis of Wavecon's 5G performance, encompassing revenue, user engagement, and market dynamics.



Analysis Focus
Throughout this project, I concentrated on:

Comparative Analysis: Developing a report comparing key metrics before and after the 5G launch to uncover trends and insights.
Data Visualization: Crafting engaging visualizations to help management easily interpret the findings.
